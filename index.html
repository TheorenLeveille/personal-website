        <p1> My name is Theoren Leveille and I am 24 years old. After highschool, I attended Thompson Rivers University, in Kamloops, and completed a Bachelor's of Science with a major in Chemical Biology. After I graduated, I moved to Vancouver in hopes I would find out what the hell i'm suppossed to do with my life. After 2 years of working as a server/bartender at the Keg Steakhouse and Bar across the street from the downmtown campus of BCIT, I finally decided to apply for the BCIT CST program. My goal is to somehow uitilize the skills I learn in this program within some aspect of the biochemical field.</p1>
